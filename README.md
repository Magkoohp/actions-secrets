# SecureStack Secrets Analysis GitHub Action

A GitHub Action that analyses your source code for secrets, credentials, API keys, server and database hostnames/URLS, and a lot more!  When you add this to GitHub Actions we will analyze your source code to make sure there is no sensitive data in your commit. See below for the specific types of credentials and files we scan for.

2. Once you are logged in go to "Settings" in the black drawer on the left, and then -> API tab.
4. Generate an API key and copy the value.
5. Go to Settings for your GitHub repository and click on Secrets -> Actions at the bottom left.
6. Create a new secret named SECURESTACK_API_KEY and paste the value from step 2 into the field.

## Retreiving your SecureStack Application ID

1. Log in to [SecureStack](https://app.securestack.com).
2. Open the application you wish to analyse.  If you haven't created a managed application you can follow the directions in this [VIDEO](https://youtu.be/mapgawLMVKg) to create one.  
3. Copy the value of the application id on the View Application screen.
4. Go to Settings for your GitHub repository and click on Secrets -> Actions at the bottom left.
5. Create a new secret named SECURESTACK_APP_ID and paste the value from step 3 into the field.

## What types of credentials does this GitHub Action find?
